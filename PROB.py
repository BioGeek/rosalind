# GC-content gives us a natural way to form a realistic random DNA string for a
# given species. If the GC-content is x, then we make the symbol frequencies of
# C and G equal to x/2 and set the symbol frequencies of A and T equal to 1âˆ’x/2.
# In other words, if the GC-content is 40%, then as we construct the string, we
# have a 20% chance of the next added symbol being 'C', a 20% chance that it is
# 'G', a 30% chance that it is 'A', and a 30% chance that it is 'T'.
#
# Given: An array A containing at most 20 real numbers between 0 and 1,
# inclusively.
#
# Return: An array B in which B[i] represents the probability (to an accuracy
# of three decimal places) that for the GC-content in A[i], two randomly chosen
# symbols will be the same.
